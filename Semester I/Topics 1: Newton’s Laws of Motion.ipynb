    "### Classical Physics Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Newton's laws of motion** describe the relationship between a physical object and the forces acting on it and its motion in response to those forces. These three laws form the foundation of classical mechanics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **First Law (Inertia)**: An object will remain at rest or in uniform motion unless acted upon by a net external force.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Second Law (F=ma)**: The acceleration of an object is proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass, F=ma.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Third Law (Action-Reaction)**: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "In quantum mechanics, **momentum** and **force** are quantized, and quantum states can be used to represent the position and momentum of particles. By using quantum gates and qubits, we can model the effects of forces on a quantum particle and simulate the changes in motion as dictated by Newton's laws."

    "### Quantum Computing Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "In quantum computing, qubits can represent the **position** and **momentum** of a particle, and quantum gates can be used to simulate the **forces** acting on the particle. The evolution of the qubit's state under these forces can be used to model **Newton’s second law** by simulating how the quantum state (analogous to velocity or momentum) evolves under the influence of force (quantum gates).\n",
    "\n",
    "By applying **Hadamard gates**, **Pauli-X gates**, and **Phase gates**, we can simulate an object’s response to a force and observe how its motion changes over time.\n",

    "### Qiskit Program to Simulate Newton’s Second Law (F = ma)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Qiskit program, we will simulate **Newton’s second law of motion** using qubits. The qubit will represent the momentum of a particle, and quantum gates will simulate the forces acting on it. We will observe how the quantum state evolves in response to these forces and how the object’s motion changes."
