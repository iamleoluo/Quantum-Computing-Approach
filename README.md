## Introduction

Quantum computing offers a revolutionary method for simulating and understanding classical physics topics by utilizing quantum mechanical principles like superposition, entanglement, and quantum interference. Classical physics often describes phenomena such as magnetism, thermodynamics, and phase transitions using deterministic models. Quantum computing, however, allows us to model these systems with unprecedented precision, capturing their quantum nature through qubits and quantum gates.

This approach allows quantum computers to simulate:
- Spin systems
- Wave-particle duality
- Quantum tunneling
- Quantum phase transitions
- Superconductivity
- Magnetism

Using frameworks like Qiskit, quantum computing provides tools for interactive simulations, enabling deeper insights into both classical and quantum phenomena.

## Features

- **Quantum Simulations**: Use quantum circuits to simulate classical physics phenomena.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Leverage Qiskit to visualize the evolution of quantum systems.
- **Real-World Physics Applications**: Explore complex systems like superconductivity and magnetism with quantum models.
